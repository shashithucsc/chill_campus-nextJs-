# Real-time Notification & UI Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address two key issues in the application:

1. The "useSidebar must be used within a SidebarProvider" error on the notifications page
2. Missing real-time notifications when users react to posts

## 1. SidebarProvider Fix for Notifications Page

### Issue
The notifications page was trying to use the `useSidebar` hook but wasn't wrapped in a `SidebarProvider`, causing the error:
```
Error: useSidebar must be used within a SidebarProvider
```

### Solution
Created a dedicated layout for the notifications page that provides the required context:

```tsx
// src/app/notifications/layout.tsx
'use client';

import { SidebarProvider } from '../home/context/SidebarContext';
import { ChatProvider } from '../home/context/ChatContext';

export default function NotificationsLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <SidebarProvider>
      <ChatProvider>
        {children}
      </ChatProvider>
    </SidebarProvider>
  );
}
```

This ensures that the notifications page has access to the same context providers as the home page.

## 2. Missing Real-time Notifications for Post Reactions

### Issue
When a user reacted (liked) a post, the action was recorded but no notification was sent to the post owner.

### Solution
Updated the post reactions API to send notifications when a post is liked:

```tsx
// src/app/api/posts/[id]/reactions/route.ts
// When a user likes a post
if (existingIndex > -1) {
  post.likes.splice(existingIndex, 1);
  action = 'unliked';
} else {
  post.likes.push(userId);
  action = 'liked';
  
  // Send notification if the post isn't by the current user
  if (post.user && post.user._id.toString() !== userId) {
    try {
      // Get liker's name
      const currentUser = await User.findById(userId).select('fullName');
      const likerName = currentUser?.fullName || 'Someone';
      
      // Send notification to post owner
      await NotificationService.notifyPostLike(
        post.user._id.toString(),
        userId,
        post._id.toString(),
        likerName
      );
      console.log(`âœ… Sent like notification to ${post.user._id} from ${likerName}`);
    } catch (notificationError) {
      console.error('Error sending like notification:', notificationError);
      // Don't block the like action if notification fails
    }
  }
}
```

The notification system now:
1. Checks if the post is not by the current user
2. Gets the liker's name from the database
3. Sends a notification to the post owner via NotificationService
4. The SocketContext picks up the notification and displays it as a toast

## Testing

To verify notifications are working correctly, you can:

1. Login as one user (User A)
2. Open another browser or incognito window and login as another user (User B)
3. Like a post created by User A while logged in as User B
4. User A should receive a real-time notification about the like

## Additional Improvements

1. Added model registration to ensure Mongoose models are properly loaded
2. Enhanced error handling to prevent silent failures
3. Improved post population logic to handle missing references gracefully

These changes ensure a more robust notification system and consistent UI experience across the application.
