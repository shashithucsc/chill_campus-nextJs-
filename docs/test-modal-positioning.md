# Report Modal Positioning Fix - Test Plan

## Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Report modal was positioning relative to the post, causing issues with small posts where the modal would cover the entire post content
- **Solution**: Modified modal to position relative to viewport center using React Portal and enhanced positioning styles

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Modal Positioning
- Added React Portal (`createPortal`) to render modal at `document.body` level
- Used fixed positioning with viewport units (`100vw`, `100vh`)
- Added explicit `z-index: 99999` for proper layering
- Used `flex items-center justify-center` for perfect centering

### 2. Improved Styling
- Added inline styles to override any parent positioning
- Enhanced backdrop with proper click-outside handling
- Added document overflow prevention for better UX
- Maintained responsive design with `max-w-lg` and padding

### 3. SSR Compatibility
- Added mounted state check for Next.js SSR compatibility
- Conditional portal rendering only on client-side

## Testing Steps

1. **Large Posts**: 
   - Navigate to posts with long content
   - Click report button
   - Verify modal appears centered in viewport

2. **Small Posts**:
   - Find posts with minimal content (1-2 lines)
   - Click report button  
   - Verify modal doesn't cover the post content
   - Verify modal appears in center of screen

3. **Different Screen Sizes**:
   - Test on mobile viewport
   - Test on tablet viewport
   - Test on desktop viewport
   - Verify modal stays centered and responsive

4. **Interaction Testing**:
   - Click outside modal to close
   - Use ESC key (if implemented)
   - Submit report form
   - Verify all interactions work correctly

## Expected Behavior
- Modal should always appear in the center of the viewport regardless of post size
- Modal should not be positioned relative to the post element
- Background should be properly blurred/darkened
- Modal should be scrollable if content exceeds viewport height
- No effect on backend functionality - only frontend positioning

## Key Files Modified
- `src/app/home/components/ReportModal.tsx`: Main modal positioning fix

## Backend Unchanged
- All report submission logic remains the same
- API endpoints unchanged
- Database interactions unchanged
- Only frontend modal positioning modified
